Scope of Electronics and Communication Engineering
</h1>
<br>
<p>
  Even imagining a life bereft of electronic gadgets seems impossible in today’s world. There is no field left across the globe where one cannot find the usage of electronics and communication engineering. Perhaps that is why electronics have become the vertebrae of digital technology. However, as a student planning to pursue Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) courses in India, one needs to walk around and try to see things from all frames.
Undoubtedly, selecting a branch of engineering from myriad options is like searching a needle from a needle stack. It is bewildering and that is why most of the students end up making the wrong choice. To avoid this, here the potential of ECE courses in paving a successful career has been discussed.
So, drive through the write-up and unfold the different chords attached to ECE courses.
<br>
<h2>Gleaming Future Prospects of ECE</h2>
This question usually pops up in the minds of many students that why to choose Electronics and Communication Engineering courses and what makes it an ideal option. Well, to answer this, it will be important to take a look at the figure provided by the Bureau Labor of Statistics (BLS).
It is predicted that the jobs for engineers will grow by 7% from 2016 to 2026. Furthermore, it has also been found that the employment in the ECE sector has amplified significantly in the last few years.
The reason behind this positive change of wind is the growing nexus between the electronics industry and the digital technology. The application of ECE in fields, such as satellite and mobile communication, digital telecommunication, power electronics, etc. has created amazing career options. Apart from this, manufacturing companies, Multinational Corporations (MNCs), research-based or industrial corporations, government authorities, aerospace manufacturing companies, consumer electronics manufacturing, healthcare tools manufacturing, Armed forces (Army/ Air Force/Navy), many others look for candidates with ECE background.
<br>
ECE engineers expertise in managing large scale research, conceptualizing, designing, developing and testing of the electronic equipment used in latest communication devices and other handy technological equipment, such as smartphones, tablets, processors, smart wrist watches, smart LED TV’s, etc. has only led to the surge in their demand.
<br>
In a nutshell, one can say that the skills of ECE engineers in planning, executing the testing process, framing of the system layouts, and delivering the end product in an impeccable way enhances their market value. This means that as an aspiring student of ECE, candidates need to ensure they select the right course in Electronics & Communication Engineering, in which they have interest and which offers better career options in the future.
<br>
The Career Choices for Electronics & Communication Engineer Graduates
One cannot ignore the fact that a few years back, there was a sudden dip reported in the jobs for ECE engineers. Nevertheless, now the situation has altered to a great extent. In fact, according to a collective survey by ASSOCHAM and NEC Corp, the electronics market of India is predicted to reach $400 billion by the year 2020 at a 41% CAGR rate.
<br>
As far as remuneration in the field of Electronics & Communication Engineering is concerned, it is important to note that there is no uniformity in this. It profusely depends on the designation of the individual and their skills.
Despite saying this, there is no qualm that Electronics and Communication Engineering is a promising growth-driven stream, and adequate knowledge in the field, when amalgamated with specific skill set, qualifies the individual for a wide range of entry-level openings. Some of the important positions that ECE pass outs can serve are listed below:
<h2>
1. Electronics Engineer</h2>
With the emerging rise in the electronics industry, new leading firms are springing up to meet the needs of the consumer market. The profile of electronics engineer has a great demand in the market and this has created a lot of opportunities for the ECE aspirants.
<h2>
2. Electronics and Communication Engineer
</h2>
ECE students could also pursue in the communications, networking, and broadcast, transmission systems work area. This work is mainly targeted to consolidate electronics, conceptualize the communication network framework, and ensure its flawless execution.
<br>

<h2>3. Electronics Design & Development Engineer</h2>

Electronics design and development is one of the most preferred choices of position by ECE graduates who want to have dazzling prospects in the electronic designing and development field.
<br>
<h2>4. Desktop Support Engineer</h2>

The profile of Desktop Support Engineer is required in almost every IT and non-IT company. This means there will be no scarcity of job options for ECE graduates in this position.
<br>
<h2>
5. System Control Engineer</h2>

System control engineer job includes not only the designing of complicated systems but also testing of it. This is one of the reasons why the candidates for this profile are recruited as technical supervisors, system control managers, etc.
