  SCOPE OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
</h2>
<p>
  <br>
Mechanical engineering is the evergreen branch among all other branches of engineering. They deal with the concepts of mechanics, thermodynamics, robotics, kinematics, structural mechanics, fluid mechanics, power sector, refrigeration, air conditioning sector and aerospace. There is a great scope of mechanical engineering now-a-days. It is expanding beyond its boundaries and more of interdisciplinary in nature. It is one of the oldest branches of engineering. This field of engineering is the broadest of all engineering fields, job prospects on offer for skilled engineer are plenty and unending. They can find employment in both government as well as private sector. Mechanical engineers are required to design, test, manufacture, install, operate and maintain a wide array of machines and mechanical systems that are used in industries. There is a great scope of job avenues for mechanical engineers in India. Few of them are listed below:
<br>

<h2>Aerospace industry:</h2>
In aerospace industry mechanical engineers are used to do resarch, design, manufacture, operate and maintain the aircrafts.
<br>
<h2>Automotive industry:</h2>
 In automotive industry mechanical engineers are used to do designing, manufacturing, distributes and perform marketing of motor vehicles.
<br>
<h2>Chemical industry:</h2> 
In chemical industry, they covers the oil companies, chemical manufactures and the business to build new chemical plants or to develop new process technologies.
<br>
<h2>
  Construction industry:
</h2> In this field of industry the role of mechanical engineer is to design and build the infrastructure and buildings and its services like heating and ventilation.
<br>
<h2>
  Defence industry:
</h2> in defence industry, they provide the equipments and provide support and services to the armed forces.
<br>
