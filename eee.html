You can also appear for PSUs like AIRPORT Authority of INDIA where Electrical & Electronics Students are allowed along with ECE students for post of Junior Executive(Electronics). That means if you are only BE/Btech in Electrical Engineering You are not Eligible to Fill the Form unless you are BE/Btech in ECE,EEE. (Status as on 09-OCT-2015)
<br>
<h2>About Branch:</h2>
EEE is almost similar to Electrical Engineering(Although Difference Exist in Courses of Curriculum of different Universities).It is not a CAKEWALK particularly if you HATE Fouries Series,Laplace Transforms,DTFT and Other Mathematical Tools.
<br>
<h2>Placement Opportunities:</h2>
(List is based on Companies Visiting BIT MESRA)
Private Companies mostly visit Top Colleges and You will HAVE VERY LIMITED Window if you are Studying in Tier 2,Tier 3 Colleges. However I am providing info assuming you are getting good IITs/NITs etc.

Assuming Seeking IT/Consultancy/Financial/Investment Role (NO INTEREST IN CORE ELECTRICAL)
Oracle Financial Services(OFSS),Saplabs,Sapient,DESHAW,MUSIGMA,EXL SERVICES,Nucleus Software,VERIZON etc.
<br>
Electronics Niche Roles:Companies like Sankalp Semiconductor,Free Scale,NI,Texas Instuments etc (where in general case ECE students are Eligible)
<br>
<h2>CORE ROLES:</h2>
Companies like Tata Steel,Mahindra,Tata Motors,Electro Steel,JSW Steel,Uttam Galva Steel,Magnetti Marelli,Exide,etc(Options along with MECH,CHEMICAL,POLYMER,PRODUCTION students)
<br>
<h2>CIVIL/CONSTRUCTION ROLES</h2>
Sampoornji Pallonji,DLF,SK Samanta & Company,TCE,BHARTI Infratel etc(Options along with Civil Students)
<br>
The List is Unending and Some Companies Have Varied Branch Eligibility Criteria in Visitng Colleges which means like TATA MOTORS also allow CSE Students in Some colleges while it may not in other.Nevertheless You Options are Optimistic
<br>
The Next Govt Jobs are Open All India Competitions where you can embank upon EEE Degree.
<br>
<h2>Government Job Opportunities:</h2>
A Rank within 500 in GATE EE Paper opens opportunities to Join IOCL,BBNL,NTPC,ONGC,NLC,PGCIL,BPCL and other MAHARATNAS,NAVRATNAS PSU
You can also opt for STATE PSUs where a majority of vacancies are from Civil,Mechanical & Electrical. State PSUs like TSGENCO,MAHADISCOM,TSTRANSCO,TSNPDCL and State Public Service Commissions like OPSC,UKPSSC etc which conduct their own Exams for AEE Recruitment
Opportunities to Join in Bureau of Indian Standards Scientist B,National Productivity Council,GRSE,ISRO (Electronics Scientist)
Most Coveted Exams like UPSC Civil Services with Electrical Optional Paper, and Indian Engineering Services(UPSC ESE)
Higher Educational Prospects
You can go for MTech/ME after Graduation from IIT,NIT and Even complete Mtech in DGFS course of BARC
You can Opt for PGDIE(Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering) from NITIE,Mumbai after QUALIFYING GATE and have good pay packages from SCM(Supply Chain Management Companies)
You can also do Mtech in QROR from ISI Kolkata. ISI - MTECH (QROR) after appearing in Entrance Exams.
<br>
The Scope of EEE branch is Unlimited Provided you Chose which Option to Opt in near future. EEE degree will provide a global arena of options but you have to tap it to become successful.
